# dense-linear-algebra
A simple, portable, Haxe-only linear algebra library that implements dense vectors and dense matrices of arbitrary dimensions. The matrices are CPU-based, and don't involve SIMD, CUDA, or OpenGL. The focus is on simplicity, portability, and convenience-of-use, not speed, optimization, or efficiency.
